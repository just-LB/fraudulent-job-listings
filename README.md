##Model Performance Summary
Our latest machine learning model achieved notable performance metrics, securing an F1 score of 0.86 and an impressive AUC score of 0.9915. While these results are slightly below the AutoGluon framework's AUC of 0.998 as reported by Grover et al. (2022), our model stands out by surpassing several other AutoML frameworks in comparative analysis.

##Potential Applications in Job Posting Platforms
Our insights hold significant potential for job posting sites such as Indeed, LinkedIn, and Glassdoor. By integrating our machine learning model into their systems, these platforms can enhance their ability to detect fraudulent job postings with high accuracy. The competitive AUC score and high F1-score, particularly for fraudulent cases, position our model as a valuable tool in the initial screening process.

Benefits for Job Posting Sites
Trust and Safety: Implementing our model can substantially increase the trustworthiness and security of the platform by proactively identifying potentially fraudulent postings.
Operational Efficiency: The automated nature of the model can decrease the need for extensive manual review, thus optimizing operational workflows and reducing the resource expenditure on manual checks.

We are confident that our model offers a robust solution that can contribute to safer and more reliable job marketplaces. For further details on our methodology and results, please refer to fraudulent-job-listings-report.pdf.
